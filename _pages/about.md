ME
------
I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Southeast University in 2025 and my B.Eng. from Hefei University of Technology in 2022. My research focuses on the dynamics, stability, and control of power-electronics-integrated power systems, with an emphasis on simulation and computing. I am particularly interested in multi-timescale modeling, simulation, and control-architecture design.
